## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

With this challenge I've learned how to properly align the elements in a way that it's responsive at any screen resolution, I had a lot of difficulties with the positioning of the picture in relation with the rest of the page, but after a few trials and errors I manage to align it. Then when it time to style the mobile version, another challenge, since I had made the entire left side one section, so I separated the logo from the rest and additional things started to get difficult. Eventually I was able to make everything work the way I wanted to, so great development with CSS.

With JavaScript it was fairly simple, with just a matter of knowing what to grab and how to check if the form was properly filled. 

### Continued development

It's clear that I need to take a look back at CSS to see the things that I've missed and things that I might not have quite understood, seems like the basics is there but with a few things missing, so I'll make sure to take a better look at this. 
In terms of JavaScript, I'm sure there are things that I need to improve, and probably there was a simpler way to do this challenge, so I'll keep on improving on that as well.
